i want to run and debug the client backend and the ai-service locally, but connect to the resources of the docker compose (minio, rabbit, mongo)

1. create additional docker-compose for dev (exactly the same just dose not run the frontend, backend, and ai-service).
2. make sure the backend and ai-service that are running localy can connect to the docker-compose resources (simply ping the resources to make sure they are availble).
3. creatre environment variables files for the backend and ai-service.
4. make sure the backend and the ai-service are loading their environment varibales files
5. create debugging configuration for the ai-service and explain to me how to run it
